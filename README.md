Glisp, an acronym for **G**raphical **LISP**, is the prototyping project to experiment what if a design tool meets a way of creative coding, and obtain the self-bootstrapping power of LISP.
This tool looks like the integration of Illustrator and Processing IDE at a glance. And in fact, it adopts both benefits of intuitiveness of direct manipulation on GUI and abstractness of programming language.

Glisp literally uses a customized dialect of Lisp as a project file. As the [Code as Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_as_data) concept of Lisp, the project file itself is the program to generate an output at the same time as a tree structure representing SVG-like list of shapes. And even the large part of the app's built-in features are implemented by the identical syntax to project files. By this nature so-called [homoiconicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity), artists can dramatically hack the app and transform it into any tool which can be specialized in various realms of graphics -- daily graphic design, illustration, generative art, drawing flow-chart, or whatever they want. I call such a design concept "purpose-agnostic". Compared to the most of existing design tools that are strictly optimized for a concrete genre of graphics such as printing or UI of smartphone apps, I believe the attitude that developers intentionally keep being agnostic on how a tool should be used by designers makes it further powerful.

## Features list I've been fantasizing

‚ú®: High priority  
üç°: Personally think it'd be cool  
üå∂Ô∏è: Important but I have no clue how to do

- [ ] UI enhancements
  - [ ] ‚ú®Selects path/group by clicking viewport
  - [ ] ‚ú®Transplants [Programmable Pen Tool](https://s.baku89.com/pentool/animation)
  - [ ] Touch-screen support
  - [ ] Much more intuitive interface for designers I prototyped [here](http://ui.baku89.com/)
- [ ] Improve the GUI to allow non-programmers edit the project without seeing any Lisp code
  - [ ] ‚ú®Layer list view
- [ ] Lisp interpreter optimization/enhancement
  - [ ] üå∂Ô∏è Incremental evaluation system to avoid the overhead by re-calculating entire project for each tweak
  - [ ] [Incremental Lisp parser](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01887230/document)
  - [ ] üå∂Ô∏è Enables to refer other node's value by relative path without explicitly defining a symbol, like Houdini's `ch("../transform/tx")` expression
  - [ ] Headless REPL environment to render images by command (partially supported)
  - [ ] Standalone JS library to dynamically render the sketch embedded in a web page
- [ ] Timeline features
  - [ ] Video exporter
  - [ ] AE-like layer view and curve editor
  - [ ] üç° [Velocity/acceleration based easing editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aBBHjqAc4Y)
- [ ] Raster image manipulation
  - [ ] Writes custom filters in GLSL ([Interactive Shader Format](https://editor.isf.video/) might be useful)
  - [ ] üç° Captures still image from video input (e.g. webcam) to make a stop-motion
- [ ] Abstraction of user inputs
  - [ ] Not only mice and keyboards, add support to bind commands with any controller's inputs via OSC/MIDI on the fly while you design. The notion "remembering hotkeys" will be vanished.
  - [ ] üç° Wouldn't it be cool if we can even use Leap Motion to record an animation...?
  - [ ] Input hooks. Quantizing, copying, flipping, and smoothing the mouse coordinate for instances.
