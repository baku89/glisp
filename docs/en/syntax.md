# Grammar of Glisp

## List and prefix notation

A language used in Glisp is based on a Lisp dialect called Clojure. Lisp is an abbreviation of **LIS**t **P**rocessor, and all the syntaxes consist of a list as the name suggests. A list is expressed by surrounded by parenthesis `()` delimited by spaces as shown below. Commas `,` are not needed.

```clojure
(max 1 2 3 4) ;; -> 4
```

In the above example, `max` is a function that returns the maximum value. A list in Lisp usually expresses a function call. For example, in `(<function name> <arg1> <arg2>)`, the first element of the list is a function name, followed by arguments that are passed to the function. This is called prefix notation. As an example, in languages similar to C/C++, addition is

```js
1 + 2
```

In Lisp, an operator `+` clammed by two values in the example above are merely a function `+`. Since the function name comes at the top, it becomes

```clojure
(+ 1 2)
```

in Lisp. This applies to regular function calls. `Math.sqrt(4)` in JavaScript becomes `(sqrt 4)`. The awkwardness in Lisp is usually because of this prefix notation, but it introduces some advantages. You will realize them as you get used to Lisp.

## Every list returns a value

Therefore, arithmetic operators, relational operators, such as `>`, variable declaration and even `if` conditions are expressed as a function call, and they return a value as evaluated. The following is a comparison between Lisp and JavaScript and their return values.

```clojure

; declaration (returns the right hand side)
; let x = 10
(def x 10) ; -> 10

; log in the console (returns null)
; console.log("Hello World")
(println "Hello World") ; -> null

; relational operator (returns boolean)
; x === 10
(= x 10) ; -> false

; if statement (returns a value similar to a ternary operator)
; (x > 5) ? "A" : "B"
(if (> x 5) "A" "B") ; -> "A"

; lambda expression (returns a function object)
; x => x * 2
(=> [x] (* x 2)) ; -> (=> [x] (x * 2))
```

## Literal

Glisp supports the following literals.

```clojure
-3.14159   ; number
"Hello"    ; string
x max      ; symbol (variable or function name)
:keyword   ; keyword (used as a map key)
true false ; boolean
null

; vector (an array data, not interpreted as a function call)
[0 1 2]

; map
{:name "Taro" :age 20}
```

Just to add, `;` is for commenting out.

## Evaluation

Lists can be nested. In this case, they are evaluated from the innermost, first list. Imagine that a list is replaced by a value as it is evaluated. The following shows how the whole line is gradually evaluated (`Ctrl+E` forces the editor to evaluate the line selected by the cursor).

## Vector

As a list surrounded by parentheses `()` is always evaluated as a function call, an error is returned when the first element is not a function.

```clojure
(0 1 2) ; error as the first element 0 is not a function
```

A vector is used instead to express a list as a data. A vector is surrounded by square brackets `[]` and in Glisp, it is used for expressing coordinates or path data.

```clojure
[50 100] ; a point at x=50, y=100
[:path :M [0 0] :L [100 100]] ; a straight line from the origin to [100 100]
```

## Differences to Clojure

That's it for the basic grammar.

For the detailed syntax, please refer to the [Introduction to Clojure (Japanese)](https://japan-clojurians.github.io/clojure-site-ja/guides/learn/syntax).

Lisp used in Glisp is a basic version based on Clojure. Some core libraries are not implemented. There are following differences in the syntax.

- Map can only have a keyword, a string or a symbol as a key.
  ```clojure
  {10 "ten"} ;; error
  {[0 1] 100} ;; error
  ```
- The order of associative destructuring is the other way round.
  ```clojure
  ;; in Clojure,
  (let [{x :A y :B} {:A 0 :B 1}])
  ;; in Glisp,
  (let [{:A x :B y} {:A 0 :B 1}]) ;; x = 0,  y = 1
  ```
- Associative destructuring using `:as` `:keys` is not supported.
- Glisp does not support namespaces (as a convention, `/` paths are used for function names)
